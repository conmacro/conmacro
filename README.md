# Conmacro

Conmacro (*construct macro*) is an exploration in how complex systems can be built.
Inspired by some of the original ideas behind literate programming, its based on the
idea of defining the entire program and its literature as abody of knowledge facts
(*constructs*) and using a rule production system (aka *expert system*) to infer
supplemental constructs & knowledge and produce verbatim files (*macro expansion*)
